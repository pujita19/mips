# mips
Designed and simulated 32 bit MIPS pipeline processor architecture using logisim.
Designed all the requirements of processor like ALU, register files, memory and control unit and pipeline architecture. Designed forwarding, stall and flush control units to prevent various data and control hazards caused because of pipeline.
